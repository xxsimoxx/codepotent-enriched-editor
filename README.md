### Pre-Installation
If you already have _TinyMCE Advanced_ or _WYWIWYG Advanced_ installed, you will need to deactivate and delete before installing _Enriched Editor_. If you want to preserve your current editor settings, you can export them to a text file before deleting the current plugin. You can then import those settings back into Enriched Editor after you get it installed.
